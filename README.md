The current project is the introductory project for The Odin Project and the first taste of HTML coding for this course.

Using Github I created a new reporitory and copied the SSH link to clone the local repository.

I used terminal to go to the README file and write a description.

I have learned the boilerplate for HTML files.

I have learned how to write good Commit messages.

I have learned what Git is and how it helps with web and app development.
